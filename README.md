The **Awtrix3 Domoticz Plugin** allows you to interact with your **Awtrix3 Smart Pixel Clock** directly from Domoticz.  

Easily send **notifications**, manage **custom apps**, adjust **brightness**, control **effects**, and toggle the clock's powerâ€”all without leaving your Domoticz dashboard.


## Features

-   **Send Notifications**: Push messages and icons to the clock via the `/api/notify` endpoint.
-   **Custom Apps**: Create or update app-specific messages using `/api/custom`.
-   **Toggle Power**: Easily turn the clock on or off.
